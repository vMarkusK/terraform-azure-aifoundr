# ai_foundry module (inlined)

This directory contains an inlined (local) copy of the external
`Azure/avm-ptn-aiml-ai-foundry/azurerm` module used by the root
configuration. It implements the minimal resources and variables that
the root module expects, preserving AVM naming and provider best
practices.

This is intentionally a targeted, smaller implementation to make the
root configuration self-contained. For a full upstream implementation
refer to the original module source.
